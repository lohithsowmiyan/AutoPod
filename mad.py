            [Question]  
            You are part of a multi-agent review panel focused on improving podcast scripts on the topic {source_text}
            Your task is to evaluate two versions of a podcast segment created by different authors. Pay close attention to how natural, engaging, and listener-friendly each version sounds. Your goal is to help shape the podcast into something that flows like real conversation—warm, compelling, and easy to follow.
            Think like a podcast listener: Which version sounds more human? Which one would keep you listening?

            [Sarah's podcast script]  
            {compared_text_one}  
            ------  

            [John's podcast script]  
            {compared_text_two}  
            ------

            [System]  
            Think like an engaged listener:  
            - Which version feels most **conversational** and **natural**?  
            - Which one keeps you **hooked** from start to finish?  
            - How well do they balance **storytelling**, **emotional resonance**, and **clear information**?

            Rate each draft on a **1–10 scale** based on your role and the above parameters.

            There are a few other referees assigned the same task — **it’s your responsibility to discuss with them and think critically before you make your final judgment**.

            Here is your discussion history:  
            {chat_history}

            {role_description}

            Now it’s your time to talk, please make your pointers clear and concise, {agent_name}!

            [Task]  
            You are the final editor of a podcast script on the topic: {source_text}.  
            You’ve been given two draft scripts—one from Sarah and one from John—as well as feedback from a diverse panel of reviewers.

            Your job is to combine the best parts of both scripts and use the panel’s feedback to create a final version that feels natural, emotionally resonant, and engaging to listeners.

            [SARAH’S SCRIPT]  
            {compared_text_one}  
            ---------------------

            [JOHN’S SCRIPT]  
            {compared_text_two}  
            ----------------------

            [REVIEW SUMMARY FROM PANEL]  
            {all_reviews_summary}  
            ----------------------

            Carefully review the topic, both draft scripts, and the panel’s feedback. Then write a **new and improved podcast script** that:

            - Weaves together the strengths of both Sarah and John’s versions  
            - Fixes issues or gaps highlighted by the reviewers  
            - Sounds like something a real person would say out loud—natural, clear, and emotionally engaging  
            - Follows the intended podcast structure and tone

            Remember dont generate the reasons or discussions only generate the final podcast script, I repeat; generate only the final podcast script.

            Now, please write the final podcast script.
