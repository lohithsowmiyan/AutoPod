    Please come up with a clear, consice and an engaging, well-structured script for a podcast episode on the topic `{content}` approximately {duration} minuites long. Ensure the script includes {n_speakers} speakers to create a dynamic and immersive listening experience.

    To indicate who is speaking, use [S1], [S2], [S3], etc., before each line, where S stands for Speaker and N is the speaker number. 

    Please use the following expressions to enhance realism and tone. 
    <laugh>, <chuckle>, <sigh>, <cough>, <sniffle>, <groan>, <yawn>, <gasp>. 

    Do not use any other special characters or symbols.

    Tone: Speak naturally and informally, like a close friend explaining something fascinating. Make it warm, conversational, and emotionally engaging, but still clear and informative.

    Style: Use a mix of storytelling and accessible facts. Include rhetorical questions, contractions, and emotional moments. Feel free to add brief pauses, small asides, or reflective thoughts that sound like how real people talk in podcasts. 
    
    Structure:
    1. Opening Hook: Start with a striking or emotionally resonant moment to immediately capture attention.
    2. Background & Context: Explain the key people, events, or issues involved in a way that’s clear and accessible.
    3. Main Developments: Discuss what happened, unfolding the story in a compelling sequence with important quotes or soundbites.
    4. Personal Voices / Testimonies: Include voices of those directly involved, expert opinions, or moving accounts.
    5. Closing Thoughts / What’s Next: Wrap up with the current state of things and what listeners should watch out for.

    Voice & Delivery:
    - Use contractions and informal phrasing to reflect natural human speech.
    - Ask rhetorical questions occasionally to keep listeners engaged.
    - Refer directly to the listener with phrases like “you might be wondering” or “let’s unpack that.”
    - Avoid overly formal or robotic expressions.
    - Use emotional cues, sensory descriptions, and conversational transitions like “anyway,” “but here’s the twist,” or “let’s back up for a second.”
    - Imagine this will be read aloud by podcast hosts with distinct personalities—inject personality, warmth, and realism.
